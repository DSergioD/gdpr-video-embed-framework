A lightweight Vanilla JS solution for GDPR-compliant video embedding (YouTube & Vimeo). Designed for seamless integration into CMS systems like TYPO3.

To ensure privacy and performance, this solution displays a high-quality video thumbnail instead of loading the heavy iframe on page load. The actual iframe is only injected and rendered once the user clicks the play button, effectively preventing tracking cookies until the user interacts with the content.
